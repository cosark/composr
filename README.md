# Composr - Docker Compose Companion

[![Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://buymeacoffee.com/vansmak)

A web-based interface for managing Docker containers and docker-compose configurations across multiple Docker hosts with powerful project creation and backup capabilities.
Created using AI - use at your own risk.

This project started as scratching my own itch - I wanted more intuitive Docker container management and couldn't find exactly what I wanted. I'm not a programmer by trade, but I had a clear vision for the solution I needed.
I used AI as a development tool to help implement my ideas faster, just like any other tool. The creativity, problem-solving, architecture decisions, and feature design are all mine - AI helped with code, syntax and implementation details. Although I run everything in my own production environment first, it is catered to my environment and is use at your own risk. All code is open source for anyone to review and audit.
The tool has been useful for me, and I shared it in case others can benefit from it too - but I absolutely understand if some prefer to stick with established alternatives.

## Key Features

### Service-Centric Model 🆕
A service's profile, compose file, and host are attributes you change directly from its own properties, not scattered one-off buttons.
- **Compose Profiles**: toggle which optional profiles are active for a stack, or mark a core service "Inactive" with one click — line-based file edits that preserve your comments and formatting, immediate redeploy (stopped services show up as a normal `Exited`/`Inactive` status, never just vanish)
- **Move a Service**: relocate a service from one compose file to another, with a preview showing a diff of both files and warnings for real risks (cross-file `depends_on`, missing `.env` variables, name/port collisions, `network_mode: host` or `build:` services that may not survive the move) before you confirm
- **Per-Stack Deploy Host**: send a stack to run on a specific connected host — if that host is offline, the deploy is refused outright, never silently redirected to local
- **Port-Conflict Resolution**: before any deploy, published ports are checked against the target host — a conflict shows exactly what's holding it, suggests a free port, or offers a different (architecture-aware) host instead
- **Properties Panel**: the container popup leads with Profile / Compose file / Host as live controls, existing actions (logs, inspect, terminal, repull, remove) below

## Multi-Host Setup

### Enabling Docker Remote API

To connect to remote Docker hosts, you need to enable the Docker Remote API on each target host.

#### Method 1: Docker Daemon Configuration
```bash
# Edit /etc/docker/daemon.json on the target host
{
  "hosts": ["unix:///var/run/docker.sock", "tcp://0.0.0.0:2375"]
}

# Restart Docker
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

#### Method 2: Environment Variable Configuration
Add to your Composr docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
services:
  composr:
    environment:
      - DOCKER_HOSTS=local=unix:///var/run/docker.sock,prod=tcp://192.168.1.100:2375,staging=tcp://192.168.1.101:2375
```

#### Method 3: Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to the **Hosts** tab in Composr
2. Click **Add New Docker Host**
3. Enter the host details:
   - **Display Name**: e.g., "Production Server"
   - **Docker URL**: e.g., "tcp://192.168.1.100:2375"
   - **Description**: Optional description
4. Click **Test Connection** to verify
5. Click **Add Host** to save

### Security Considerations
⚠️ **Important**: Only enable the Docker Remote API on trusted networks. For production environments, consider using TLS certificates for secure connections.

Composr logs a startup warning if `AUTH_USERNAME`/`AUTH_PASSWORD` aren't set, since every endpoint (including container exec and compose file read/write) is open without them. When auth is enabled, `/login` has basic rate-limiting (5 attempts, 5 minute lockout per source).

## Project Creation Wizard

The Project Creation feature supports multi-host deployment:

### How to Use
1. Go to **Config** tab → **Create** subtab
2. **Step 1**: Enter project name, choose location, and customize the compose template
3. **Step 2**: Review your project and choose deployment target:
   - **Local Docker**: Deploy to the local Composr host
   - **Remote Host**: Select any connected Docker host for deployment
   - **Create Only**: Just create the project files without deployment

### Multi-Host Features
- **Host Selection**: Choose which Docker host to deploy your new project to
- **Cross-Host Deployment**: Deploy from Composr to any connected Docker host
- **Host-Specific Validation**: Ensures target host is available before deployment
- **Deployment Feedback**: Detailed success/failure information for multi-host deployments

## Container Operations Across Hosts

### Supported Operations
- **Start/Stop/Restart**: Control containers on any connected host
- **Remove**: Delete containers from remote hosts
- **Logs**: View real-time logs from containers on any host
- **Terminal**: Execute commands in containers regardless of host location
- **Inspect**: View detailed container information across hosts
- **Batch Operations**: Perform actions on multiple containers across different hosts

### Host Identification
- **Host Badges**: Every container shows which host it belongs to

```

#### ⚠️ Important Safety Notes

**🔴 CRITICAL: This feature is experimental and untested in production environments.**

- **Test thoroughly** in development before using in production
- **Always backup** your containers and compose files before enabling auto-updates
- **Start with exclusions** - exclude critical production containers initially
- **Monitor logs** for update operations and errors
- **Verify updates** work correctly before enabling automation
- **Have rollback plan** ready in case updates cause issues

**Recommended First Steps:**
1. Enable update **checking only** (disable auto-updates)
2. Test manual updates on non-critical containers
3. Verify backup and rollback functionality
4. Gradually enable auto-updates for safe containers only
5. Monitor for several weeks before fully trusting the system

**Not Recommended For:**
- Database containers without proper backup strategies
- Containers with custom configurations that may break
- Production systems without thorough testing
- Containers that require manual intervention during updates
- Any container where downtime is not acceptable

#### Configuration Location
Update settings are stored in: `${METADATA_DIR}/container_update_settings.json`
